# My favourite scripts

## About

I have been using Linux for over a decade and with time my scripts folder has never stopped growing. I offer you a humble list of scripts I have found to be of some use on my system. Most of them have served as daily drivers for work and studies and I hope you find them useful just as well.

I shan't attribute any of them as they have been compiled over the course of all those years and I simply have no clue where the sources are. I shall however do so in the future.

Please note that I actually built up this "library" of scripts to solve real-life tasks on my system. Some you'll find to be too trivial and some too useful to pass on. This will be important for the Contribution section below.

The way I am going to present them is a category-based approach. It should reduce the time for any user to browse the requred section for further details.

## Contributions

I am happy to expand my collection. This is why the project has two folders in its root - "angryteach" and "extra". It will make me happy to merge any of your pull requests for scripts that are not in my set. However, there are a couple of rules:

1. Any script offered for merging will go to the "extra" folder upon review.
2. I shall only add your scripts to "angryteach" folder only when I actually start using them on my system. Every contribution will be properly attributed.
